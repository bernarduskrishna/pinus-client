### Culture/Focus:

PH is a relatively new hall with a focus on Frugality and Sustainable Living. PH provides a safe and reliable environment for new students adjusting to the university life in NUS. With various interest groups to join and the signature Peer Mentorship Programme, freshmen would surely feel safe and secure to explore NUS. Moreover, PH offers a more relaxed lifestyle as compared to other halls that place emphasis on Sports and Cultural activities. PH provides a flexible option for students to join CCAs within PH or outside of PH ( other NUS CCAs ).

### CCAs/Interest Groups

1. Sports (Badminton, Basketball, Dodgeball, Floorball, Frisbee, Road Relay, Soccer, Table Tennis)

Super Snacks sells Waffles, Fries, Burger, etc and is usually a favourite destination for those that enjoy eating supper since it is open until late at night.

### People/Community:

1. PH offers flexibility for students who want to focus on their studies. When other halls might require active participation in Hall CCAs, PH is designed to be more accomodating for those that enjoy to study or would like to spend their time doing things outside of PH.
2. PH offers a peer mentor system in each cluster. Cluster is a social group usually classified based on the floor you lived in and usually consists of people who study the same subject as you do. Peer mentors are seniors who would take care and look out for you throughout the semester, being a support system and go-to person if you need any help with school or adjusting to university life.

### So, Why PH? And Why NOT PH?

1. WHY PH: If you are a freshman that is worried about fitting in the NUS ecosystem, PH is a safe place for you to explore and grow. With the Peer Mentorship programme, you will surely feel that someone is supporting your early days in NUS. Moreover, PH offers a flexible living option that allows students to focus on their studies instead of being required to spend their time in various Hall CCAs. This is especially favourable for those that tend to prefer alone time. However, since PH is a new hall, you have a huge flexibility to pioneer something in PH. The PH ecosystem allows you to easily start an interest group and will be willing to provide support for you to start one. PH also offers classes on selected General Elective modules, such as GER1000H (Quantitative Reasoning), which allows students to study and meet their university requirements in the comfort of their homes.
2. WHY NOT PH: If you are an extrovert that enjoys being involved in various Hall CCAs, PH is not the place for you. PH, being a relatively new hall, does not provide that much Hall CCA options compared to the other more established halls. Moreover, if you are interested in challenging yourself intellectually beyond the normal curriculum provided by NUS, PH does not provide a special educational programme as compared to the Residential Colleges in University Town.
