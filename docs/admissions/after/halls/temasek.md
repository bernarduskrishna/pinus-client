### People/Community, according to Felix, a Temasek Hall resident:

Temasek Hall excels in both culture and sports, although we lost the overall Inter-Hall Games champion title several times to our yellow neighbor. Temasek has numerous CCAs ranging from cultural, sports, media and many more. Apart from CCAs, Temasek Hall also has a lot of activities such as angels and mortals, overnight cycling, block out, level out, Halloween, etc.

### Sports-oriented:

As Temasek Hall is known to be one of the top-achieving halls when it comes to sports, slots in CCAs are rather competitive! Also, brace yourselves as trainings are rigorous.
