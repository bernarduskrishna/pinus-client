### Tips for Dining at Hall:

1. Want an extra meal? Fret not! Simply ask in your block group chat for an extra matric number! Or, you can also wait up to 9PM and be entitled to get another meal yourself with your matric card \*(note: unlike the residential colleges, halls do not allow you to keep your meal credits and reuse them another time)
2. Want larger meal portions? Quietest on Friday and Sunday nights, since most Singaporeans will go back to their homes to eat, or eat out. So usually on these nights, they will serve larger portions of dinner. Or, if you’re lucky, can simply ask the meal servers to give you an extra scoop of food.
3. People in the block may come out with trumpets and go on knocking on every door to call you for dinner, watch out! (yes, hall is really rowdy you see), but I guess this is how they maintain their closely-knit “family” vibe with one another.

### Welfare:

1. Recess week and reading week (before midterms and exams): Check out for your block lifts, they will sneak in some goodies in a basket!
2. You will be greeted by a welfare pack on your first days at SH and also a welcome gift after coming back from a semester.
3. Along the semester, Sheares Welfare will treat you to surprise welfare like mala, prata, acai, hotpot… KEEP A LOOKOUT!
4. Every level has a lever rep, who will provide welfare throughout the semester. They also will arrange level outings! Fun fun!
5. It’s your birthday? Shearites are family! We celebrate your birthday with your level mates!

### People/Community:

1. There will never be a peaceful day at hall. Either it is your block event or dinner gathering, someone will jio (“invite”) you for supper or go out for drinks/clubs. Or some people may just gather in rooms and chit-chat or grind for exams together. (\*note: it is a hall culture to leave your doors open or unlatched, because we are a very open and family-like community)
2. More than other halls, SH is known for being the most rabak (“lively”), they are a very vibrant and rowdy community. Expect to still hear voices at 3AM in the morning. Sometimes, it can be pretty exhausting to keep up, but if you’re the rowdy type as well, then SH will be a great family for you.

### Specific Amenities:

1. Lounge (in each block) to relax with your block mates, with air-conditioning, TV, entertainment, board games (depending on your block)
2. Kitchen (in each block, with 4 electric stoves, 2 refrigerators, sink, microwave, oven, and some utensils), pantry with microwave and water cooler (in every floor)
3. Multi-purpose Hall (can fit up to 450 people, fully air-conditioned, mainly used for CCAs)
4. SCRC Meeting Room (can fit up to 20 people, sometimes used for classes)
5. Gymnasium (can fit 15 people, from bench press to dumbbells, all equipment is there)
6. Laundry Rooms (FREE washing machines and free dryers). Sheares hall is the only hall with free washing machine AND dryer!
7. Roof-top Terrace (benches and open air, great for BBQ and chilling with your block mates!)

### So, Why SHEARES? And Why NOT SHEARES?

1. WHY SHEARES: If you are someone who likes to meet new people, socialize, and love to have night life, choose Sheares! Shearites are known to be friendly and really open to each other.
