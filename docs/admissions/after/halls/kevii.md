### Why KEVII, according to an anonymous resident:

_"TIAP HARI NAIK 88 ANAK TANGGA_
_WOW SERU SEKALI_
_DI MANA LAGI BISA MENDAPATKAN PENGALAMAN INI KALO BUKAN DI KEVII_
_TERIMAKASIH KEVII"_

1. Location-wise, KEVII is very near to Medicine and Science (5 mins walk), Kent Ridge MRT (7-8 minutes walk/with shuttle bus). There is also a bus stop outside KEVII (PGP Terminal), so it is convenient to take the shuttle bus to UTown, Kent Ridge, Engineering, etc
2. In terms of hall life, I think KEVII’s CCAs are more open to newbies, so if you want to try out new things, KEVII’s CCAs provide a very supportive environment.
3. I also heard from my seniors that KEVII has the largest single rooms!
