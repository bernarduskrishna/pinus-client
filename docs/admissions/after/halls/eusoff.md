### Why Eusoff, according to Bima, a current Eusoff resident:

Eusoff hall is located near FASS and Computing, making it really accessible for students from these faculties. Eusoff Hall is also the closest hall to the Kent Ridge Terminal bus stop, making it really accessible (even until past 12 am!). I personally like Eusoff because of its rich culture, especially in sports, where we have won the last 3 consecutive inter-hall games. Our performance arts are equally as competitive, as we have drama, dance, and choir.

We also boast one of the largest, if not the largest, rooms amongst other Halls and Residential Colleges, making it really spacious and comfortable.

Usually people are afraid of hall commitment. However, fret not because Eusoff hall people are very friendly and open to international students. And when you do the things you like with the people you like in a hall you love, nothing is too much!
