# Medical Checkup

We strongly encourage you to conduct your medical examination in NUS to avoid any unwanted complications and incompatibilities that can arise if you complete the test in Indonesia. Please **do not delay** in taking this test because you will need it for the issuance of Student Pass.

For the latest information, please refer [here](http://www.nus.edu.sg/uhc/general-health/medical-examination/pre-admission/pre-admission-medical-exam)

### Booking

Early booking is essential to get the date you want! [Book your appointment here](https://www.gevme.com/nus-pre-admission-medical-examination-2020). It will cost \$55 (fifty-five Singapore dollars) for you to get the test done here.

### Things to prepare

Several things to take note:

- Bring your documents and items required for the medical checkup.
- Your passport
- Medical history/reports written in English (if any)
- Cash or NETS card
- [NUS Medical Examination Form](http://www.nus.edu.sg/uhc/docs/default-source/default-document-library/undergraduate.pdf?sfvrsn=62ea6b98_2) with **Part I completed**
- Prescription eyewear / contact lens
- Wear a plain t-shirt or blouse (but if you don’t have one, it’s okay, usually they’ll ask you to wear their disposable X-ray gown anyway).
- **For girls**, please do the medical examination at least 5 to 7 days after the end of your period, since there will be a urine test. However, if that’s not possible they usually allow you to take the urine test some other time.

The medical examination will be at the University Health Centre (UHC), NUS (_it’s not in NUH :)_)
