# Registration: Part 2

In this part of the registration process, _usually_ you would be given your Student Card in person and asked to activate it. However, due to the COVID-19 situation, NUS will activate the card on your behalf.

Please write to ugregistration@nus.edu.sg to indicate your consent for them to activate your NUS Student Card.

If you are under 18 years old at the point of completion of Registration Part 1, please email to ugregistration@nus.edu.sg the scanned copy of the following forms from Registration Part 1, signed by your parent/guardian, before continuing on to Registration Part 2:

- Risk Acknowledgement and Consent
- Authorisation of Medical Procedures
- Nomination of Local (Singapore-based) Representative

They will follow-up via NUS email on the collection of the Student Card after arriving in Singapore.
