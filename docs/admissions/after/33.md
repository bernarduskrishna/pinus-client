Source: [https://thehoneycombers.com/singapore/singlish-101/](https://thehoneycombers.com/singapore/singlish-101/)

This list of words and phrases is not exhaustive :)

**Eh**
What it means: Eh is basically how you address people or get their attention.
Example: You would ask a colleague “Eh, wanna have lunch?” or call a friend to ask “Eh, would you like to gym later?” or even text your brother “Eh, I’m not coming home for dinner tonight.”

**Lah**
What it means: A suffix used to place emphasis on the sentence or word before.
Example: “Don’t worry about it lah!” Or, get used to hearing “Out of stock lah.”

**Leh and Lor**
Lah is easy enough to master, but leh and lor? Not so much.
What it means: Use leh when you’re not sure about something – it’s more like a question.

Example:
A: What time does the concert start?
B: I don’t know leh. Aren’t you the one that booked the tickets?

What it means: Lor holds a sense of resignation and finality when used at the end of a sentence. Like there’s nothing to do about it, let’s move on. Think c’est la vie with a sense of ennui. Why are you so sad? Because life happens, lor.

Example: “Like that, lor”

**Chope**
What it means: To reserve a place or call dibs on something.
Example: “Can you chope a seat for me?”

**Tapao**
What it means: The Singlish equivalent of takeaway.
Example: “I’m going to tapao lunch from the hawker centre.”

**Cheem**
What it means: If something has got you dumbfounded, perplexed, bewildered, confused or any synonym related to these words, that thing is cheem.
Example: “This exam question is cheem” or “She writes in a really cheem way.”

**Shiok**
What it means: Fantastic, or to convey feelings of satisfaction and pleasure.
Example: “This plate of chicken rice is damn shiok.”

**Paiseh**
What it means: A Hokkien term for embarrassing and shy. If you’re out for a big meal and there’s a little left on a sharing plate that nobody wants to take, it’s also known as the ‘paiseh piece’.
Example: “Paiseh – can you lend me some cash?”

**Sian**
What it means: As long as you’re experiencing boredom, a lack of enthusiasm or just tired of life. Basically this word can be used in a multitude of contexts.
Example: “Time is passing so slowly, sian” or “I hardly slept today, sian.”

**Atas**
What it means: This word was recently added to take Oxford dictionary (yay Singlish). It means to be posh or of high social status.
Example: “The meal we had at that fine dining restaurant was so atas”, or “Wow, look at the way that girl dresses, it’s so atas!”

**Kiasu**
What it means: A fiercely competitive spirit.
Example: “She queued for four hours to get the latest iPhone – so kiasu!”

**Can or not?**
What it means: A way of asking if something is possible/can be achieved.
Example: “Dinner at 7? Can or not?”
