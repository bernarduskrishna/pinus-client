# Photo Submission

A photograph of you must be submitted for making your Student Card at the online photo submission system **2 working days after the acceptance of offer of admission**.

Do check on the [requirements of the photograph](http://nus.edu.sg/registrar/info/info/Requirements-of-Photograph-for-Online-Submission.pdf) before submission as well. You are required to submit your photograph before the deadline.

You need to check the status of your photo submission several days after submitting, since it might be rejected by the system. If it is rejected, just re-upload the photo, making sure that you follow the requirements!

You can submit your photo via the [Online Photo Submission](https://myaces.nus.edu.sg/photoVerification/PhotoVerificationNewLoginServlet?hAction=newStudent) portal.
